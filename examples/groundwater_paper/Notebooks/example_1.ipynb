    "Aquifer recharge is simulated with the Recharge package (RCH) and the extraction of water at the two ditches is simulated with the Well package (WEL). The latter requires specification of the layer, row, column, and injection rate of the well for each stress period. The layers, rows, columns, and the stress period are numbered (consistent with Python's zero-based numbering convention) starting at 0. The required data are stored in a Python dictionary ({\\tt lrcQ} in the code below), which is used in FloPy to store data that can vary by stress period. The {\\tt lrcQ} dictionary specifies that two wells (one in cell 1, 1, 51 and one in cell 1, 1, 151), each with a rate of -1 m$^3$/m/d, will be active for the first stress period.  Because this is a steady-state model, there is only one stress period and therefore only one entry in the dictionary."
